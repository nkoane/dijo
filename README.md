# DIJO Starter Pack

Okay, this was a classwork task I used to demonstrate how to build a web application to my students, but after some serious amount of boredom, I figured I could make it an actually application that people could use to manage their chiya-nyama (pop-up shop as the Americans call it).

## What is DIJO?

Is an application that allows the owner of the chiya-nyama to manager orders as they comein and for the kitchen staff to see the orders coming in, and clear them as they are collected by customers.

That's it, that's the whole application. I will add more functionality as I time allows.

### How to run the application

You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. Then you can run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Afterwhich, you can access the dashboard, to setup the database, and create the administrator, which would then allow you to add whatever it is that you are selling.  For now, the assumption is that all foods fall into the following categories:

- Starch
- Meat
- Vegetables
- Drinks

## Questions?

I do not know why you'd need to ask questions, but shoot your shot.
