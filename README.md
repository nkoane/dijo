# DIJO Starter Pack

Okay, this was a classwork task I used to demonstrate how to build a web application to students, but after some serious amount of boredom, I figured I could make it an actual application that people could use to manage their chisa-nyama (pop-up shop as Americans call it).

## What is it?

dijo an application that allows the owner of the chisa-nyama (pop-up shop) to place orders; and for the kitchen to see the orders coming in, and clear them as they are collected by customers.

That's it, that's the whole application. I will add more functionality as I time allows.

### How to run the application

This is still work in progress, I'll add this once I have a working protoype.

Afterwhich, you can access the dashboard, to setup the database, and create the administrator, which would then allow you to add whatever it is that you are selling.  For now, the assumption is that all foods fall into the following categories:

- Starch
- Meat
- Vegetables
- Drinks

## Questions?

I do not know why you'd need to ask questions, but shoot your shot.
